# Licensing Intent (Draft) – OHM Smart Contracts

The smart contract code in this repository is intended to be released under a strong copyleft open-source license (for example, AGPL‑3.0) to ensure that modifications and deployments remain part of the public-good commons.

Until a final license text is selected and added here, this code should be treated as “all rights reserved” and is not yet licensed for reuse.

Once we have confirmed the final license with legal counsel, we will add the full license text and update this notice.
